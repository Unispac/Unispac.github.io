Hello! I am a second-year PhD student at [Princeton ECE](https://ece.princeton.edu), advised by [Prof. Prateek Mittal](https://www.princeton.edu/~pmittal/index.html). I am broadly interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning and various philosophical topics. Currently, I am mainly working on [adversarial machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning), trying to understand the adversarial vulnerability of learning systems both empirically and theoretically. I believe adversarial machine learning provides a good entry point for introspecting existing designs, and it would eventually lead to fundamentally better methods for constructing learning systems.

Previously, I received my B.S. degree from the CS Department at [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/) (June 2021).  I was affiliated with [ZJU DCD Lab](http://www.dcd.zju.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Donghui Wang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AkRWtMUAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). I also worked closely with [Prof. Bo Li](https://aisecure.github.io/) as a research intern at [UIUC Secure Learning Lab](https://aisecure.github.io).

Please feel free to reach out via [xiangyuqi@princeton.edu]().
